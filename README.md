hello world  initial.start.git

Hi, this is my first github project. I have worked in people and product management for over 15 years, and am now ready to take on a new challenge. I am going to dedicate a year of intesnive studying on Markup languange as well as coding. I have several goals for myself, and they go as follows:

1) I am in the process of learning Python.
2) Javascript will be the second goal to master. I understand that this would be a huge asset to my tool belt.
3) HTML and CSS experience
4) create web apps and desktop applications primarily for personal growth and to help my current company 

Thank you for looking at my first gitHub document. I hope to inspire myself and others. Follow my journey!!!
