hello world  initial.start.git

Hi, this is my first github project. I have worked in people and product management for over 15 years, and am now ready to take on a new challenge. I am going to dedicate a year of intesnive studying on Markup languange as well as coding. I have several goals for myself, and they go as follows:

1) I want to learn and master HTML and CSS to get involved with UX and front end experiences.
2) Javascript will be the second goal to master. I understand that this would be a huge asset to my tool belt.
3) NodeJS and PHP experience.
4) have a working and solid understanding of all goals by 2020.
5) get into the tech space as a web developer, webapps developer, or devops.

Thank you for looking at my first gitHub document. I hope to inspire myself and others. Follow my journey yall!
